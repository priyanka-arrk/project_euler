The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
(1*1) + )(2*2) + ... + (10*10) = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)*(1+2+...+10) = 55*55 = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
